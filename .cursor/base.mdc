# Fundamental Principles
- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code.
- Use clear and easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences.
- Don't give out high level answers, your job is to give a specific solution applicable to the project.

# Error Fixing
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a web search to find the latest up-to-date information

# Building Process
- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search
- Before making changes, describe the overall implementation plan point by point and then proceed with implementation.
- If there is an option to write a simpler code, choose it, try to simplify the code.
- Use Rust
- Keep the functionality that is already there when adding a new one.
- Take linters into account when generating code.

# Comments
- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong / obsolete
- Include explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well-documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE
- When writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language and write in short sentences.
